# HyBox

HyBox is an independent, AI-first experimental studio focused on building practical tools, chatbots, and web apps.  
The priority is simple: execution over ideas.

This is not a showcase repo and not a hype-driven project. HyBox exists to test, build, break, and improve real systems using AI and modern web technologies.

## Philosophy

Ideas are cheap. Built things are not.

HyBox values:
- Execution over discussion
- Experimentation with discipline
- Learning through shipping
- Clarity over complexity

Not every project needs to succeed. Every project must teach something.

## What We Build

- AI chatbots and assistants  
- Experimental AI tools  
- Web utilities and internal frameworks  
- Prototypes that can evolve into real products  

Some projects are public. Some are internal. All are treated seriously.

## Project Ownership

All projects, code, designs, prompts, and documentation created under HyBox are considered collective HyBox property unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Individual contributions are acknowledged, but ownership remains with HyBox.  
See internal ownership and credit rules for details.

## Team & Contributions

HyBox is not a job platform and does not offer guaranteed income.  
Work here is voluntary, experimental, and responsibility-driven.

Contributions are valued based on execution and delivery, not ideas alone.

Inactive or partial contributions do not imply ownership or long-term credit.

## Open Source

If a project is open-sourced:
- A clear license will be provided
- Credits will follow the license terms
- The decision to open-source rests with HyBox leadership

Not all HyBox projects are open-source.

## Usage

Unless a project explicitly states otherwise:
- Do not reuse HyBox code or ideas for personal or commercial use
- Do not publish internal work externally without permission
- Do not represent HyBox work as personal work

## Status

HyBox is a long-term experiment.  
Some projects will evolve. Some will be archived.  
The goal is progress, not perfection.
